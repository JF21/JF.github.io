            <p>
            I like coding, electronics, and flight. And I don't mind getting hands on in the physical world as well. Next year I will be further developing these interests and others at the University of Michigan. As of now, I've had a great time gaining experience in computer science, robotics, and engineering both at my highschool and outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              Projects are my focus. Classes and theory are nice and all, but you can't really see progress until you've applied them. Although I have been involved in a few interesting projects, I hope that the best of what I do is still to come.

                    This project was the product of both boredom and a challenge given to me in Honors Computer Science III. We were learning how to use ActionListeners, MouseEvents, and Draw methods in Java. 
                 </p>
                <p>
                    From these concepts, I came up with a tank shooter game. The tank is moved with WSAD keys and the turret is controlled by the scroll wheel. This was definitely the most rewarding project that year and resulted in more experiences in working with Java.

                    Gridworld Tetris is a version of Tetris made using the GridWorld API, which is part of the AP Computer Science A case study. The game plays like regular tetris, with the exception of special audio effects, and an endscreen featuring Mr. T.

                    From this project, I solidified my understanding of the Java language. It was after this initial understanding that I was able to move on to other programming languages. Such as Python or Javascript.

                    For three years, I have worked with my High School's Vex Robotics or FTC Robotics team. As a team member, I learned the basic syntax of C as I help code the robot in a language called RobotC. I have also gained an abundant exposure to the workings of electrical sensors and electrical hardware.

                <p>
                    Our hard work on the team paid off when we attended the Vex Robotics World Championships in 2013 at the Anaheim Convention Center.

                    Asside from coding and electronics, I have always found a fascination in flight. This interest was pursued through my school's Science Olympiad team. Over the years, I consistently worked on the competition's flying events, building elestic launched gliders in 2013 and 2014, and a rubber band powered prop plane in 2015. My interests in aviation have taught me a lot about aeronautical engineering, from the effects of an tilted horizontal stabilizer, to the importance of proper decalge in powered flight.

                    In 2014, I was fortunate to attend the New Jersey Governor's school of Engineering and Technology, where I took classes in everything related to engineering. I learned Android developement, Arduino, and most interestingly, this branch of Computer Science called formal verification.

                    Using a little know language created by Microsoft called Dafny, my group mates and I implemented 4 different sorting algorithms that were mathematically proven to be correct by dafny. It is quite fascinating that the work we did, implementing these algorithms cold be done without ever touching a keyboard or booting up a computer. The beauty is that this type of computer science can be done completely with Mathematical logic alone.
